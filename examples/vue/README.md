# @vime/vue-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and demonstrates how to setup
Vime with Vue via the `@vime/vue` package. See [`src/App.vue`](./src/App.vue), and if you're
interested in building custom components see [`src/TapSidesToSeek.vue`](./src/TapSidesToSeek.vue).

## Usage
